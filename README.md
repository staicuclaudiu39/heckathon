### Front-End
We utilized React JS for our project and incorporated external libraries to add additional API functionalities.
### Back-End
We utilized a combination of Python, Flask, and Replicate API to create an image using our AI based on a given input text. The Front-End section makes a request to our API using the data it obtains. In response, our API returns the URL of the photo to the Front-End section.
